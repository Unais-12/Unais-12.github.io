    <h3>⭐4/5 Stars: Great Value and Expertise</h3>
    <h3>Naval Asim | 15th October 2025</h3>
    <p>The guides were excellent—so much local knowledge and very professional. The trip provided fantastic value for the price. I wish the hotel in Gilgit had been a little closer to the main bazaar, but overall, it was a memorable and well-executed tour package.</p>
